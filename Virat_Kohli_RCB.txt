Kohli playing his famous flick shot in CWC 2015
Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanor.
[368][369] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[370] 
and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, 
and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[371][372] In his batting technique, 
Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots 
and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[373][374]

Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural 
aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[7] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot,
Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg 
and mid-on.[375] Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on 
with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements
enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[376] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for
his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.

However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[377] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by 
targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[378] This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous 
occasions.[379][380] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[381][382]
and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[383]

Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batsman by cricketing experts and aficionados alike.[384][4] 
In ODIs, he boasts an average of 66 runs when batting second and 48 runs when batting first.[385] He has amassed 26 of his 46 ODI hundreds in run-chases, 
and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second.[386] In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a 
fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation 
and execute boundary hits.[387] His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces 
behind his success.[388][389]
